	Easter 4

Beloved in Christ
I've just been chatting to some parishioners, and laughingly commented that the first topic of conversation is the weather, and so it should be, as it is changeable and directly affects us!  All in the midst of spring... I'd forgotten how nature's episodes show off the snowdrops, then daffodils, then bluebells, then buttercups, nettles ----- and it's so with us - God is revealing seasonal changes in us, and we are always taken by surprise by the renewing season of feeling change, and warmth in our spirits.  We are on our way to Pentecost, aren't we?  I pray that your encounters with the resurrected real Jesus are sustaining you, and maybe giving you new insights. St Augustine said that  we are spiritual beings on an earthly journey.  Let us live into that and be sure that every day we are attending to the spiritual garden God is now giving us time to potter around in!

ZOOM conversations on Wednesday meetings at 8pm are wonderful: last week we looked at how to 'do' church when we come out of lockdown: we started to picture ourselves arriving, listening to scripture and exploring God's new way of being not do-ing in a changed world,  preparing for communion and partaking in it, (not to forget taking collection). Next week we return to a more spiritual, reflective focus and discussion.  We need that spiritual nourishment. We have decided to open our link to anyone you would recommend joining.  Fresh insight is so valuable, and refreshing. 

WEBSITES: Christine and Betty have added to our internet pages - do take a look at stmaryschurchnewportontay.org and stmargarettayport.org. It's great that we are sharing photos and these newsletters.  It would be marvelous to have some overseas interest in joining Zoom! 

SERVICES I hope you are enjoying the Episcopal video of the Eucharist on Sundays at 11 (or  you can watch them later at your convenience). By the way a lot of people are enjoying the flexibility of worship, during this lockdown. I continue to celebrate the Eucharist, tomorrow at 11 at St Mary's.  You will see some photos of St Margaret's last week. I was very moved to look from the altar at the empty church, and longed for you to take up your usual places!  It is a beautiful experience for me, and I am aware of your presence, and pray for each of you. Do join me once again. In the afternoon at 4, I have another dedicated prayer and healing service, and have decided rather to hold that at home, than to transgress the law and go out again in a day. Light your little candle and join me. 

READINGS. Are you enjoying the Eucharist readings - I think we should keep to them throughout our green Easter season.

FACE MASKS That strange picture shows you how well the little masks I made for you work.  I made several rows of reinforcing stitches so that they are more durable. Do use them when you shop!Please pray for Steve and Dorothy Lemon, who showed some cv symptoms and are in self isolation.
 
ENJOY this time - make it God space

<h2>Beloved in Christ</h2>
 
<p>Here are last Sunday's photos of our beautiful churches, as I celebrated and prayed: not only each of you, but in seeking God's assurance and guidance as we seek to be together in the future.  We all yearn for that sacred companionship.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will be celebrating the Eucharist at St Margaret's at 11, and then praying in St Mary's round 4pm for an hour. Do join me in spirit. I also hope you are enjoying the Diocesan online service at 11am, or using some other form of worship of your choice.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining in Zoom on Wednesday, in prayer or in person. Here is the link for you to join up or forward to friends - regardless of creed, religion, or place. We can spread the net wider with the wonders of technology.  On reflection I wondered whether this global community is gathering in this new way, right across the globe.  Let's do this here! Perhaps your family further afield would like to join us?  Next week I am planning a reflection (a personal perspective) to start our discussion and prayer.  It was special to meet face to face, and lovely to have the whole Sage family and doggie present on the screen for the hour. (I'll send the invitation to next week's Zoom link separately, forwarded from Niki)</p>

<p>Here are next week's readings</p>

<p>Sunday - Acts 2: 14a, 36 to 41; Psalm 116: 1 to 4, 11 to 18; 1 Peter 1: 17 to 23; Luke 24: 13 to 35<br/>
Monday - Acts 6: 8 to 15; Psalm 119: 161 to 168; John 6: 22 to 29<br/>
Tuesday - Acts 7: 51 to 8: 1a; Psalm 31 : 1 to 5; John 6: 30 to 35<br/>
Wednesday - Acts 8: 1b to 8; Psalm 66: 1 to 6; John 6: 35 to 40<br/>
Thursday - Acts 8: 26 to 40; Psalm 66: 7 to 8, 15 to 19; John 6: 44 to 51<br/>
Friday - Acts 9: 1 to 20; Psalm 132; John 6: 52 to 59<br/>
Saturday - Acts 9: 31 to 42; Psalm 116: 11 to 18; John 6: 60 to 69</p>

<p>Once again, I extend the invitation to stay in touch and phone or email me in any need</p>
<p>Yours, in the risen Lord</p>
<p>Kathy</p>

<h2>Beloved in Christ</h2>

<p>I am very aware of the vitality of Palm Sunday in our Christian calendar.</p>

<p>I wonder how your Lenten journey has been, with its sudden deviation into new ways of accepting living with social distancing, empty streets and often away from those we love and rely on as integral parts of our lives. Many working people have lost jobs and purpose... many we love are imperiled. We are in grief in its stages of anger, denial, bartering and then, ultimately, acceptance. </p>
 
<p>In addition there is too much information and inspiration on hand. Technology has leapt into new dimensions- we are intimidated by the panoply of choice. </p>

<p>We have set up this email communication, to re-plant us in our sustaining church community, and to keep together and share. </p>

<p>Lets turn to PALM SUNDAY READINGS</p>
<p>Isaiah 15: 4-9a</p>
<p>Psalm 31:9-18</p>
<p>Philippians 2:5-11</p>
<p>Matthew 26: 11 to 54 (remember the Passion readings?)</p>

<p>*Jesus knew what was to come. We don't!</p>
<p>*Jesus nevertheless knew what he had to do. We do, mostly! </p>
<p>*Jesus knew that God's plan was for him to show the way to salvation. Do we know what God is asking us to do right now? Are we listening? </p>
<p>*Jesus accepted the honour, joy and celebrations,without being swayed by them.. this is discernment in the face of worldly opinions. </p>
<p>*Jesus is the model of humility..... are we?</p>
<p>If we just STAY with these thoughts as we reflect, and steep ourselves in that peace that passes all understanding, then the waves of outer noise and emotion give way to the currents running,  just as our River Tay illustrates, under the surface turmoil.</p>
<p>And then, that deep underwater stillness holds us steady.</p>
<p>We are a people of faith, YOU are God's  chosen one, with a particular purpose and LOVED. (Ephesians1: 5 although, better, 1.15)</p>

<p>NOW is the time to talk to God about these things, for you are a LOVED new creation (2 Corinthians 5: 17)</p>
<p>Perhaps this is what this Easter is guiding us to...</p>

<p>The collect is:</p>
<p>Eternal father</p>
<p>Your son our saviour fulfilled your will</p>
<p>By taking our nature and giving his life for us.</p>
<p>Help us to follow the example of his humility</p>
<p>By walking I  the way of the cross;</p>
<p>through the same Jesus Christ our Lord,</p>
<p>who lives and reigns with you and the Hily Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.</p>
<p>(taken from the South African lectionary).</p>


<p>Do have a look at the links I sent you in the last email for 'live' services and do share if you have others... Frank, thank you for your prayers sent!</p>

<p>SUGGESTION</p>
<p>MAKE A PALM CROSS from your garden shrubbery, and pin it to your front door or gate. This is for you, your household and  a witness to those walking by. I am going to do this and will send you a pic. Then at first light on Easter Sunday(or after your Saturday evening devotions), I'm stringing lights through them!</p>

<p>Lastly, what about playing and singing and praying a HYMN, like 'Ride on, ride on in majesty' <a href="https://youtu.be/MD9rMkIS1yw">https://youtu.be/MD9rMkIS1yw</a></p>
<p>Yours in humility and joy.</p>

<p>I will send you some thoughts on holy week soon.</p>
<p>BE BLESSED AS YOU ARE A BLESSING TO OTHERS</p>
<p>Kathy</p>

<h2>An official greeting from Kathy Barrable</h2>
<p>Beloved in Christ</p>
<p>This day, the 24th March 2020, I'm formally your Priest-in-Charge, and I am filled with joyful anticipation. God has worked the whole miracle and blessings have flowed, ever since I attended St Margaret's almost two years ago, and returned home saying, 'I love the people and this place - I could live here - even without you precious family!' And when I attended a joint meeting at St Mary's the circle grew wider, and now it is here like a jewel to behold. I promise to serve God, you and the churches to the best of my ability, and with that same faith hope and love which is ours to share and explore.</p>
<p>So, not being able to meet you yet, I plan to phone those who are not on email, and give you my phone number, 07552 503895, so that we can open doors to talk, plan, share and dream. Our chats should be broad..... how you are coping, what you are thinking, any birthdays or special news, questions and answers, and whatever affects our wellbeing. (This morning I have learned about gardening and that it's still too cool to sow seeds yet.) I am sure you will be able to help me in these practical ways - what can I do for you?</p>
<p>I will send you weekly emails, and a Sunday sermon, readings for the week, as well as some interesting connections for you to listen to: I hope you will feed back, as to what is on your mind. </p>
<p>I know a number of us are in the vulnerable group, and to you specially, if there is any help you need, let us know.  </p>
<p>I wonder if anyone has contact with an an IT boff, who could possible help us record a sermon, and get us linked somehow. </p>
<p>Perhaps you would think its a good idea to share a communion which I would have, and you be with me in prayer at the same time? Perhaps 10 on a Sunday morning? (I will celebrate the Eucharist then) and join me at 6pm, in evening prayer - said evensong on a Sunday night, and daily morning prayer at 7.30am: </p>
<p>Today's Eucharist readings are Ezekiel 47,  1-9 and 12; Psalm 46; and John 5 1-18. Lovely question Jesus poses: do you WANT to be healed?</p>
<p>Morning and evening prayers are:</p>
<p>Today, Tuesday Jeremiah 16: 10-21; Romans 7; 13-25; John 6: 16-27</p>
<p>Wednesday Jeremiah 17.10:19 -18:12; Romans 8 1-11; John 6: 16-27.</p>  
<p>Thursday Jeremiah 22: 13-23.  Romans 8: 12-27; John 6: 41-51</p>
<p>Friday Jeremiah 23 1-8; Romans 8:28-39; John 6: 52-59</p>
<p>Saturday Jeremiah 23:9-32; 1 Romans 9: 1-18; John 6: 60-71 </p>
<p>I know we have a lot of resources being worked on and shared, and I'll send them to you as they come. With so much available, just select what you would enjoy, keeping it manageable, nourishing and digestible! </p>
<p>Some starters: this is a wonderful time for deepening our prayer life, and whilst there are endless ideas on youtube, one I recommend is 'Prayer: Rowan Williams, (other helpful instructive podcasts like 'Encountering God' and so on...) He is eloquent and keeps his message accessible and practical.</p>
<p>I've recently become more interested in the field of Ecotheology, and discovered Michael Dowd, American minister and author, in his series called, 'Post Doom Conversations', in which he chats to a number of eminent people, and exchanges views. Perhaps you would enjoy those?</p>
<p>And of course, my all time default, Richard Rohr. Any of his books or youtube recordings.</p>
<p>In the mean time, let us love one another as Jesus' disciples, and live joyfully in these time, eve grateful for our blessings.</p>
<p>Peace and grace</p>
<p>Kathy Barrable</p>

			<h2>120th anniversary of St Margaret’s</h2>
			<p>On Sunday 20th November 2016 St Margaret’s Episcopal Church, Tayport, celebrated its 120th anniversary at a special service, led by Rev Jim Thomson, in honour of the church’s patron saint, Queen Margaret of Scotland. The congregation of St Margaret’s were joined in this celebration by their friends from St Mary’s Episcopal Church, Newport-on-Tay. The organist was Iain Flett, and we were also treated to some fine violin music by his daughter Elisabeth.</p>
